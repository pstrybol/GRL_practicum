# Graph Representation Learning practicum
This practical only depends on one external reposirtory: [NetworkAnalysis](https://github.com/pstrybol/NetworkAnalysis).
All the relevant code is in the jupyter notebook `gr_code.ipynb` and the necessary data is in `data/`. In the notebook various questions are listed which you can copy paste into `Q&A.md` and write your answers to each of them. Also, write your personal questions/feedback on the practicum in this markdown file.
